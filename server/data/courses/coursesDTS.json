How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new media of communication had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? All of these questions and many more form part of the subject matter of Diaspora and Transnational Studies. This introductory course ex-amines the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved. The area of study is comparative and interdisciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, history, the arts and humanities. Accordingly, this course provides the background to the subject area from diverse perspectives and introduces students to a range of key debates in the field, with particular attention to questions of history, globalization, cultural production and the creative imagination.</p>", "title": "Introduction to Diaspora and Transnational Studies I (formerly DTS201H1, 202H1)", "levelOfInstruction": "undergratuate", "prerequisitesText": "", "corequisitesText": "", "exclusionsText": "DTS201H1, DTS202H1", "recommendedPreparation": "", "division": "Arts and Science, Faculty of", "breadthRequirements": ["Creative and Cultural Representations (1)", "Society and its Institutions (3)"], "distributionRequirements": ["Humanities, Social Science"]}, "faculty": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadths": [{"org": {"code": "ARTSC", "name": "Faculty of Arts and Science"}, "breadthTypes": [{"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Creative Cultural", "description": "BR=1 Creative and Cultural Representation", "code": "BR=1"}, {"kind": "BREADTH", "type": "Society Institutions", "description": "BR=3 Society and Its Institutions", "code": "BR=3"}]}], "notes": []}, {"name": "Qualitative and Quantitative Reasoning", "code": "DTS300H1", "sectionCode": "F", "campus": "St. George", "sessions": ["20169"], "sections": [{"name": "LEC0101", "type": "Lecture", "sectionNumber": "0101", "meetingTimes": [{"start": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 46800000}, "end": {"day": 4, "millisofday": 54000000}, "building": {"buildingCode": "SS", "buildingRoomNumber": "1069", "buildingUrl": null}, "sessionCode": "20169"}], "instructors": [{"firstName": "A.", "lastName": "Arhin"}], "currentEnrolment": "56", "maxEnrolment": "60", "teachMethod": "LEC", "currentWaitlist": "0", "subTitle": "", "enrolmentInd": null, "cancelInd": "N", "waitlistInd": "N", "deliveryModes": [{"session": "20169", "mode": "CLASS"}], "notes": [], "enrolmentControls": [], "linkedMeetingSections": []}], "cmCourseInfo": {"description": "<p>Focuses on research design and training in methods from history, geography, anthropology, literary and cultural studies, and other disciplines appropriate to Diaspora and Transnational Studies.
